        Use Cloudflare's "1.1.1.1 for Families" DNS-based blocking?
        <input type="radio" name="dns_blocking" id="dns_blocking_yes" value="dns_blocking_yes"><label for="dns_blocking_yes">Yes</label>
        <input type="radio" name="dns_blocking" id="dns_blocking_no" value="dns_blocking_no" checked><label for="dns_blocking_no">No</label><br /><br />
        Read <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-1-1-1-1-for-families/" target="_blank">Cloudflare's post about "1.1.1.1 for Families"</a> for more info.<br />
        When enabled, this plugin will first check to see if the domain the image is coming from is a known adult content provider before doing scanning via AI.<br />
        There are advantages of enabling DNS blocking as an additional check:<br />
        <ul>
            <li>Checks videos. The AI does not currently check videos.</li>
            <li>Provides a second check on images.</li>
            <li>Done as a pre-check, so if it is blocked the request to get the image is cancelled and the slower AI doesn't need to run.</li>
        </ul>
        There are, however, some disadvantages:<br />
        <ul>
            <li>Requires a call to Cloudflare's servers with the hostname (e.g. "google.com") of items being checked from your browsing session.</li>
            <li>Because blocking is performed based on hostname, it can sometimes block all media for a website with many types of content.</li>
        </ul>
        Please make the choice that is right for you!
